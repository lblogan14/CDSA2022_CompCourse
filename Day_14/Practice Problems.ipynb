The problems come from the book I used in my computational course. The book we used was _Computational Physics_ by Mark Newman (the first edition). I find it to be a really useful reference book for python. \n","\n","\n","##Problem 1 (3.2 - Curve Plotting)\n","\n","Although the ```plot``` function is designed primarily for plotting standard _xy_ graphs, it can be adapted for other kidns of plotting as well.\n","\n","a) ***Make a plot of the so-called _deltoid_ curve***, which is defined parametrically by the equations:\n","\n","$x = 2cosθ + cos2θ, \\quad \\quad y = 2sinθ - sin2θ$\n","\n","where $0 ≤ θ < 2π$. Take a set of values of θ between zero and 2π and calculate _x_ and _y_ for each fromm the equations above, and then plot _y_ as a function of _x_.\n","\n","b) Taking this approach a step further, one can make a polar plot $r = f(θ)$ for some function _f_ by calculating _r_ for a range of values of θ and then converting _r_ and θ to Cartesian coordinates using the standard equations $x = rcosθ, y = rsinθ$. Use this method to ***make a plot of the Galilean spiral*** $r= θ^2$ for $0 ≤ θ ≤ 10π$.\n","\n","c) Using the same method, ***make a polar plot of \"Fey's function\"***\n","\n","$r = e^{cosθ} - 2cos4θ + sin^5 \\frac{θ}{12}$ \n","\n","in the range $0 ≤ θ \\le 24π$.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"6oC_yFUStwXe"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"DK0k0TytttgK"},"outputs":[],"source":["##imports here\n","\n","\n","\n","## part a\n","\n","\n","\n","##part b\n","\n","\n","\n","##part c"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Problem 2 (8.8 - Space garbage)\n","\n","A heavy steel rod and a spherical ball-bearing, discarded by a passing spaceship, are floating in zero gravity and the ball bearing is orbiting around the rod under the effect of its gravitational pull (ask Caroline to draw this -- after you try drawing it! -- if you need assistance visualizing). \n","\n","\n","For simplicity we'll assume that the rod is of negligible cross-seciton and heavy enough that it doesn't move significantly, and thatthe ball bearing is orbiting around the rod's mid-point in a plane perpendicular to the rod.\n","\n","Note: treating the rod as a line of mass _M_ and length _L_ and the ball bearing as a point mass _m_, the attractive force F felt by the ball bearing in the direction toward the center of the rod is given by:\n","\n","$F = \\frac{GMm}{L} (x^2 + y^2)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\int _{-L/2} ^{L/2} \\frac{dz}{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^{3/2}}$\n","\n","where _G_ is Newton's gravitational constant and _x_ and _y_ are the coordinates of the ball bearing in the plane perpendicular to the rod.

Calculate the orbit from $t=0$ to $t=10$ and make a plot of it, meaning a ***plot of $y$ against $x$***. You should find that the ball bearing does not orbit in a circle or an ellipse as a planet does, but has a precessing orbit, which arises becasue teh attractive force ins not a simple $1/r^2$ force as it is for a planet orbitting the Sun.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"W4cWAubP0lCy"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["##imports here\n","\n","\n","##constants/conditions of the problem here\n","\n","\n","##define the differential equations here\n","\n","\n","##define a DE sovler (e.g. RK2 or RK4) \n","\n","\n","##create what you're going to plot\n","\n","\n","\n","##plot here"],"metadata":{"id":"2AJoT2785Mcd"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
