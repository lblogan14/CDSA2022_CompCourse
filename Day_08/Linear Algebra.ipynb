With \n","this notation the  problem can be rewritten as $A v = 0$ where the matrix $A$ is defined by $A \\equiv M - \\lambda I$. Of course, \n","we know how \n","to solve the system $Av =0$: simply invert the matrix $A$ and mutiply both sides of the equation by $A^{-1}$. (Better yet, use \n","the `linalg.solve` command in numpy.) This yields the \n","trivial solution $v = 0$.  Note that $v=0$ is _always_ a solution to our original problem, $Mv = \\lambda v$. In fact, it is the \n","only solution assuming that the matrix $A \\equiv M - \\lambda I$ is invertible. However, for certain special values of $\\lambda$ \n","called _eigenvalues_, this matrix will _not_ be invertible and the system $M v = \\lambda v$ will have nontrivial solutions for $v$. \n","The nontrivial vectors $v$ are called _eigenvectors_. \n","\n","The eigenvalue/eigenvector problem consists of finding all of the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ such that $M - \\lambda I$ is not invertible, then \n","for each eigenvalue finding a corresponding eigenvector $v$ that satisfies $Mv = \\lambda v$.
