We can make this question more precise. Suspend a\n","chain (or rope or cord) of length $L$ from its ends, which are fixed to the points $(x_a,y_a)$ and\n","$(x_b,y_b)$ in the $x$-$y$ plane. What is the curve $y(x)$ taken by the chain? To answer this question,\n","we first derive an ordinary differential equation satisfied by the function $y(x)$. The equation\n","can be solved numerically as a __boundary value problem__. With a boundary value problem, the\n","freely chosen data are specified at the boundaries (or endpoints) of the system. \n","In contrast,\n","the freely chosen data for an _initial value problem_ consist of initial dataâ€”--typically the initial\n","positions and velocities. For the hanging chain, the boundary data (or boundary\n","conditions) consist of the relations $y_a = y(x_a)$ and $y_b = y(x_b)$.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"J72OMSUI6Sa3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["From the slides, we find:\n","$$\n","        y_i = \\frac{1}{2}(y_{i+1} + y_{i-1}) - \\frac{k h^2 }{2}\\sqrt{1 + (y_{i+1} - y_{i-1})^2/(2h)^2} \\ .\n","$$"],"metadata":{"id":"DlMcWlNxh4SI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Problem 1\n","\n","Write a code that uses relaxation to solve the differential equation above.
