Youâ€™ll find that it takes about a million possible arguments, but only three are necessary: the function that computes the derivative, the initial value, and the time axis. We could thus define a function that looks like our Euler/RK2 solvers that calls the scipy integrator as follows:\n",

        "And, for reference, below is code that Caroline wrote during undergrad that shows basic implimentation of RK4. The original context of the homework problem has been lost (that's why it's super important to comment your code!!), but the point is that I wrote a function for the differential equation and then all I had to do was call `RK4`. If I had been really slick, I could have had the arguments that feed into the code include a function for a differential equation. But, the point is, the logic of RK4 is below if you have a function to define the associated differential equation."
