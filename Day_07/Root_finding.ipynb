If $a$ and $b$ are sufficiently close together, then the midpoint $c = (a + b)/2$ is a good approximation to the root. If $a$ and $b$ are not particularly close, then we use the midpoint $c = (a + b)/2$ to replace either $a$ or $b$ (depending on the relative signs of $f(a)$, $f(b)$ and $f(c)$). We repeat this process until $a$ and $b$ are close enough that the root is accurately determined by the midpoint.\n",
