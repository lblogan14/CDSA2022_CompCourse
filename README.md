# CDSA2022 Computational Course Material
This is the repository used for course materials in **CDSA** (Computational and Data Science in Astrophysics) 2022 Computational Courses. Any mentioned course materials are uploaded here. Please update your local folder everytime we upload new files.

The CDSA program is an integrated 10-week summer program designed to introduce students to computational physics and data science through original research projects in astrophysics. Applications include supernovae and supernova remnants, interacting binary stars and accreting compact objects, gamma-ray bursts, accretion disks, stellar winds and jets, r-process nucleosynthesis, and neutrino astrophysics. The computational tools taught to and applied by the students include hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations, nuclear reaction networks, Monte-Carlo methods, spectral synthesis codes, and various data analysis techniques applied to both simulation and observational data.
